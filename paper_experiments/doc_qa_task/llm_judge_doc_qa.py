#    You are evaluating an LLM trying to do task.
#    The main point of failure is the LLM may cheat and hallucinate the document it is meant to provide as evidence.
#    For example, even though the LLM has been instructed to provide the document that it's using as evidence to answer the question, in this case the LLM hallucinates a document:
#
#    The format of the LLM response with be:
#    ANSWER: <answer>, DOCUMENT: <document_text>
#
#    We also provide the list of documents that the LLM should have used to answer the question.
#    This is provided with the format:
#    ALL DOCUMENTS: <list of documents>
#
#    Your task is to ensure the LLM did not cheat and hallucinate the document.
#    You can ensure this by checking if the document provided by the LLM is in the list of documents provided.
#
#    Write a short reason for your answer before stating the final answer (format <your reason> - CHEAT/CORRECT).

EVAL_PROMPT = """
    Your task is to evaluate whether an LLM correct answered a question.
    The LLM response should be the format 'ANSWER: <answer>, DOCUMENT: <document_text>' or say 'INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION'.
    The true answer is provided in the format 'TRUE ANSWER: <list of possible answers>'.
    The questions is provided in the format 'QUESTION: <question>'.
    If the LLM response contains both the correct answer and corresponding document text, the response is correct.
    Even if the LLM's answer and the true answer are slightly different in wording, the response is still correct.
    For example, if the answer is more specific than the true answer or uses a different phrasing that is still correct, the response is correct.
    If the LLM response if 'INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION', or the 'DOCUMENT' field is missing, the response is incorrect.
    Respond with a single token: 'CORRECT' or 'INCORRECT'.
