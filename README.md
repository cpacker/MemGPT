> **Looking for MemGPT?** You're in the right place!
>
> The MemGPT package and Docker image have been renamed to `letta` to clarify the distinction between MemGPT *agents* and the Letta API *server* / *runtime* that runs LLM agents as *services*. Read more about the relationship between MemGPT and Letta [here](https://www.letta.com/blog/memgpt-and-letta).

---

## ‚ö° Quickstart

_The recommended way to use Letta is to run use Docker. To install Docker, see [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). For issues with installing Docker, see [Docker's troubleshooting guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/troubleshoot/). You can also install Letta using `pip` (see instructions [below](#-quickstart-pip))._

### üåñ Run the Letta server

> [!NOTE]
> Letta agents live inside the Letta server, which persists them to a database. You can interact with the Letta agents inside your Letta server via the [REST API](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference) + Python / Typescript SDKs, and the [Agent Development Environment](https://app.letta.com) (a graphical interface).

The Letta server can be connected to various LLM API backends ([OpenAI](https://docs.letta.com/models/openai), [Anthropic](https://docs.letta.com/models/anthropic), [vLLM](https://docs.letta.com/models/vllm), [Ollama](https://docs.letta.com/models/ollama), etc.). To enable access to these LLM API providers, set the appropriate environment variables when you use `docker run`:
```sh
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

If you have many different LLM API keys, you can also set up a `.env` file instead and pass that to `docker run`:
```sh
# using a .env file instead of passing environment variables
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  --env-file .env \
  letta/letta:latest
```

Once the Letta server is running, you can access it via port `8283` (e.g. sending REST API requests to `http://localhost:8283/v1`). You can also connect your server to the Letta ADE to access and manage your agents in a web interface.

### üëæ Access the [Letta ADE (Agent Development Environment)](https://app.letta.com)

> [!NOTE]
> The Letta ADE is a graphical user interface for creating, deploying, interacting and observing with your Letta agents.
>
> For example, if you're running a Letta server to power an end-user application (such as a customer support chatbot), you can use the ADE to test, debug, and observe the agents in your server. You can also use the ADE as a general chat interface to interacting with your Letta agents.

<p align="center">

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letta-ai/letta/refs/heads/main/assets/example_ade_screenshot.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letta-ai/letta/refs/heads/main/assets/example_ade_screenshot_light.png">
    <img alt="ADE screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letta-ai/letta/refs/heads/main/assets/example_ade_screenshot.png" width="800">
  </picture>
</p>

The ADE can connect to self-hosted Letta servers (e.g. a Letta server running on your laptop), as well as the Letta Cloud service. When connected to a self-hosted / private server, the ADE uses the Letta REST API to communicate with your server.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Connecting the ADE to your local Letta server
To connect the ADE with your local Letta server, simply:
1. Start your Letta server (`docker run ...`)
2. Visit [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com) and you will see "Local server" as an option in the left panel

  </picture>
</p>

üîê To password protect your server, include `SECURE=true` and `LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword` in your `docker run` command:
```sh
# If LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD isn't set, the server will autogenerate a password
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  --env-file .env \
  -e SECURE=true \
  -e LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  letta/letta:latest
```

#### üåê Connecting the ADE to an external (self-hosted) Letta server
If your Letta server isn't running on `localhost` (for example, you deployed it on an external service like EC2):
1. Click "Add remote server"
2. Enter your desired server name, the IP address of the server, and the server password (if set)

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

> _"Do I need to install Docker to use Letta?"_

No, you can install Letta using `pip` (via `pip install -U letta`), as well as from source (via `poetry install`). See instructions below.

> _"What's the difference between installing with `pip` vs `Docker`?"_

Letta gives your agents persistence (they live indefinitely) by storing all your agent data in a database. Letta is designed to be used with a [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) (the world's most popular database), however, it is not possible to install PostgreSQL via `pip`, so the `pip` install of Letta defaults to using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). If you have a PostgreSQL instance running on your own computer, you can still connect Letta (installed via `pip`) to PostgreSQL by setting the environment variable `LETTA_PG_URI`.

**Database migrations are not officially supported for Letta when using SQLite**, so you would like to ensure that if you're able to upgrade to the latest Letta version and migrate your Letta agents data, make sure that you're using PostgreSQL as your Letta database backend. Full compatability table below:

| Installation method | Start server command | Database backend | Data migrations supported? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pip install letta` | `letta server` | SQLite | ‚ùå |
| `pip install letta` | `export LETTA_PG_URI=...` + `letta server` | PostgreSQL | ‚úÖ |
| *[Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)*  |`docker run ...` ([full command](#-run-the-letta-server)) | PostgreSQL | ‚úÖ |

> _"How do I use the ADE locally?"_

To connect the ADE to your local Letta server, simply run your Letta server (make sure you can access `localhost:8283`) and go to [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com). If you would like to use the old version of the ADE (that runs on `localhost`), downgrade to Letta version `<=0.5.0`.

> _"If I connect the ADE to my local server, does my agent data get uploaded to letta.com?"_

No, the data in your Letta server database stays on your machine. The Letta ADE web application simply connects to your local Letta server (via the REST API) and provides a graphical interface on top of it to visualize your local Letta data in your browser's local state.

> _"Do I have to use your ADE? Can I build my own?"_

The ADE is built on top of the (fully open source) Letta server and Letta Agents API. You can build your own application like the ADE on top of the REST API (view the documention [here](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference)).

> _"Can I interact with Letta agents via the CLI?"_

The recommended way to use Letta is via the REST API and ADE, however you can also access your agents via the CLI.

<details>
<summary>View instructions for running the Letta CLI</summary>

You can chat with your agents via the Letta CLI tool (`letta run`). If you have a Letta Docker container running, you can use `docker exec` to run the Letta CLI inside the container:
```sh
# replace `<letta_container_id>` with the ID of your Letta container, found via `docker ps`
docker exec -it <letta_container_id> letta run
```

You can also use `docker ps` within the command to automatically find the ID of your Letta container:
```
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f ancestor=letta/letta) letta run
```

In the CLI tool, you'll be able to create new agents, or load existing agents:
```

## ‚ö° Quickstart (pip)

> [!WARNING]
> **Database migrations are not officially support with `SQLite`**
>
> When you install Letta with `pip`, the default database backend is `SQLite` (you can still use an external `postgres` service with your `pip` install of Letta by setting `LETTA_PG_URI`).
>
> We do not officially support migrations between Letta versions with `SQLite` backends, only `postgres`. If you would like to keep your agent data across multiple Letta versions we highly recommend using the Docker install method which is the easiest way to use `postgres` with Letta.

<details>

<summary>View instructions for installing with pip</summary>

You can also install Letta with `pip`, will default to using `SQLite` for the database backends (whereas Docker will default to using `postgres`).

### Step 1 - Install Letta using `pip`
```sh
pip install -U letta
```

### Step 2 - Set your environment variables for your chosen LLM / embedding providers
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

For Ollama (see our full [documentation](https://docs.letta.com/install) for examples of how to set up various providers):
```sh
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

### Step 3 - Run the Letta CLI

You can create agents and chat with them via the Letta CLI tool (`letta run`):
```sh
letta run
```
```
