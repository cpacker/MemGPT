    "# Agentic RAG with Letta\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll go over how to implement agentic RAG in Letta, that is, agents which can connect to external data sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Letta, there are two ways to do this: \n",
    "1. Copy external data into the agent's archival memory\n",
    "2. Connect the agent to external data via a tool (e.g. with Langchain, CrewAI, or custom tools) \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these approaches has their pros and cons for agentic RAG, which we'll cover in this lab. "

By his own account, he said he was trying to be different, trying to be “cool.” He said he also was trying to reinvent himself: “It was when I made a conscious decision: I want to grow up.” And, to his mind, Barack sounded much more grown-up than Barry. When he moved back to Hawaii to attend a private school four years later, he was still Barack Obama.

Two of these cases involved ACORN suing Governor Jim Edgar under the new Motor Voter Act,[78][79] one involved a voter suing Mayor Daley under the Voting Rights Act,[80] and one involved, in the only case Obama orally argued, a whistleblowing stockbroker suing his former employer.[81]\\nAll of these appeals were resolved in favor of Obama's clients, with all the opinions authored by Obama's University of Chicago colleague Chief Judge Richard Posner.[82]\\nObama was a founding member of the board of directors of Public Allies in 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993.[55][83] From sixth grade through eighth grade at Punahou, Obama lived with his mother and Maya.[35][36]\\nObama's mother completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for an M.A. in anthropology in December 1974.[37] After three years in Hawaii, she and Maya returned to Jakarta in August 1975,[38] where Dunham completed her contract with the Institute of Management Education and Development and started anthropological fieldwork.[39]\\nObama chose to stay with his grandparents in Honolulu to continue his studies at Punahou School for his high school years.[8][40]\\n In the summer of 1981, Obama traveled to Jakarta to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of Occidental College friends in Hyderabad (India) and Karachi (Pakistan) for three weeks.[49]\\nHe then transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a speciality in international relations[50][51] and in English literature.[52] Obama lived off campus in a modest rented apartment at 142 West 109th Street.[53][54]\"},\n",
