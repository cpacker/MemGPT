Terms of Service
================

**Binding Agreement**. This is a binding contract ("Terms") between you and the developers of MemGPT and associated services ("we," "us," "our," "MemGPT developers", "MemGPT"). These Terms apply whenever you use any of the sites, apps, products, or services ("Services") we offer, in existence now to created in the future. Further, we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these Terms will apply to such upgrades. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you use our services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these terms on behalf of that organization. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.

**Privacy**. See our Privacy Policy for details on how we collect, store, and share user information.

**Age Restrictions**. The Services are not intended for users who are under the age of 13. In order to create an account for the Services, you must be 13 years of age or older. By registering, you represent and warrant that you are 13 years of age or older. If children between the ages of 13 and 18 wish to use the Services, they must be registered by their parent or guardian.

**Your Content and Permissions**. Content may be uploaded to, shared with, or generated by MemGPT -- files, videos, links, music, documents, code, and text ("Your Content"). Your Content is yours. MemGPT does not claim any right, title, or interest in Your Content.

You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to do the things we need to do to provide the Services, including but not limited to storing, displaying, reproducing, and distributing Your Content. This license extends to trusted third parties we work with.

**Content Guidelines**. You are fully responsible for Your Content. You may not copy, upload, download, or share Your Content unless you have the appropriate rights to do so. It is your responsibility to ensure that Your Content abides by applicable laws, these Terms, and with our user guidelines. We don't actively review Your Content.

**Account Security**. You are responsible for safeguarding your password to the Services, making sure that others don't have access to it, and keeping your account information current. You must immediately notify the MemGPT developers of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. MemGPT will not be liable for your acts or omissions, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions.

**Changes to these Terms**. We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know, for example by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new Terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using MemGPT within the designated notice period. Your continued use of MemGPT will be subject to the new Terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
