> [!NOTE]
> **Looking for MemGPT?** You're in the right place!
>
> The MemGPT package and Docker image have been renamed to `letta` to clarify the distinction between MemGPT agents and the API server / runtime that runs LLM agents as *services*.
>
> You use the **Letta _framework_** to create **MemGPT _agents_**. Read more about the relationship between MemGPT and Letta [here](https://www.letta.com/blog/memgpt-and-letta).
