# Frequently asked questions

## MemGPT CLI

### How can I use MemGPT to chat with my docs?

Check out our [chat with your docs example](../example_data) to get started.

### How do I save a chat and continue it later?

When you want to end a chat, run `/exit`, and MemGPT will save your current chat with your agent (make a note of the agent name, e.g. `agent_N`). Later, when you want to start a chat with that same agent, you can run `memgpt run --agent <NAME>`.

### I already pay for ChatGPT, is this the same as GPT API?

No, ChatGPT Plus is a separate product from the OpenAI API. Paying for ChatGPT Plus does not get you access to the OpenAI API, vice versa.

### I don't want to use OpenAI, can I still use MemGPT?

Yes, you can run MemGPT with your own LLMs. See our section on local LLMs for information on how to set them up with MemGPT.
