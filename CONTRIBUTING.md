# 🚀 How to Contribute to MemGPT

Thank you for investing time in contributing to our project! Here's a guide to get you started.

## 1. 🚀 Getting Started

### 🍴 Fork the Repository

First things first, let's get you a personal copy of MemGPT to play with. Think of it as your very own playground. 🎪

1. Head over to the MemGPT repository on GitHub.
2. In the upper-right corner, hit the 'Fork' button.

### 🚀 Clone the Repository

Now, let's bring your new playground to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MemGPT.git
```

### 🧩 Install Dependencies

**Installing dependencies with poetry** (recommended):
```shell
cd MemGPT
pip install poetry
poetry install -E dev -E postgres -E local -E legacy
```
If you are managing dependencies with poetry, you will need to run MemGPT commands with `poetry run memgpt run`. 

**Installing dependencies with pip**:
```shell
cd MemGPT
# Optional: set up a virtual environment.
# python3 -m venv venv
# . venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev,postgres,local,legacy]'
```

#### (Optional) Installing pre-commit
We recommend installing pre-commit to ensure proper formatting during development:
```
poetry run pre-commit install
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 2. 🛠️ Making Changes

### 🌟 Create a Branch

Time to put on your creative hat and make some magic happen. First, let's create a new branch for your awesome changes. 🧙‍♂️

```shell
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

### ✏️ Make your Changes

Now, the world is your oyster! Go ahead and craft your fabulous changes. 🎨

## 3. ✅ Testing

Before we hit the 'Wow, I'm Done' button, let's make sure everything works as expected. Run tests and make sure the existing ones don't throw a fit. And if needed, create new tests. 🕵️

### Run existing tests

Running tests if you installed via poetry:
```
poetry run pytest -s tests
```

Running tests if you installed via pip:
```
pytest -s tests
```

### Creating new tests
If you added a major feature change, please add new tests in the `tests/` directory.

## 4. 🧩 Adding new dependencies 
If you need to add a new dependency to MemGPT, please add the package via `poetry add <PACKAGE_NAME>`. This will update the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files. If the dependency does not need to be installed by all users, make sure to mark the dependency as optional in the `pyproject.toml` file and if needed, create a new extra under `[tool.poetry.extras]`. 

## 5. 🚀 Submitting Changes

### Check Formatting
Please ensure your code is formatted correctly by running:
```
poetry run black . -l 140
```
