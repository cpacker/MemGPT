# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. Here is an overview:

- **Basic Telemetry Collection:** When you use Letta applications/services/websites, we collect anonymous telemetry data such as clicks and crashes.  
  - This data helps us understand user behavior, enabling us to improve the Letta application(s) and prioritize features and bug fixes.
  - **Opt-Out Option:** To disable basic telemetry, modify your configuration file by setting `telemetry_disabled = True`.
  
- **Data from Hosted Services:** When you use Letta-hosted services (e.g., hosted endpoints or the Discord Bot), we collect data necessary to render these services.  
  - For example, we may collect data like message requests and responses.
  - **Data Use:** This data may be used to improve our services, including training new models.
  - **Data Scope:** We do **not** collect data on any of your messages or prompts unless you’re using our hosted services.

Below is our full Privacy Policy, detailing the above points and more.
