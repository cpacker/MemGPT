# 🚀 How to Contribute to MemGPT

Thank you for investing time in contributing to our project! Here's a guide to get you started.

## 1. 🚀 Getting Started

### 🍴 Fork the Repository

First things first, let's get you a personal copy of MemGPT to play with. Think of it as your very own playground. 🎪

1. Head over to the MemGPT repository on GitHub.
2. In the upper-right corner, hit the 'Fork' button.

### 🚀 Clone the Repository

Now, let's bring your new playground to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MemGPT.git
```

### 🧩 Install Dependencies

**Installing dependencies with poetry** (recommended):

First, install Poetry using [the official instructions here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Once Poetry is installed, navigate to the MemGPT directory and install the MemGPT project with Poetry:
```shell
cd MemGPT
poetry shell
poetry install -E dev -E postgres -E local
```

Now when you want to use `memgpt`, make sure you first activate the `poetry` environment using poetry shell:
```shell
$ poetry shell
(pymemgpt-py3.10) $ memgpt run
```

Alternatively, you can use `poetry run` (which will activate the `poetry` environment for the `memgpt run` command only):
```shell
poetry run memgpt run
```

**Installing dependencies with pip**:

First you should set up a dedicated virtual environment. This is optional, but is highly recommended:
```shell
cd MemGPT
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

Once you've activated your virtual environment and are in the MemGPT project directory, you can install the dependencies with `pip`:
```shell
pip install -e '.[dev,postgres,local]'
```

Now, you should be able to run `memgpt` from the command-line using the downloaded source code (if you used a virtual environment, you have to activate the virtual environment to access `memgpt`):
```shell
$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ memgpt run
```

If you are having dependency issues using `pip`, we recommend you install the package using Poetry. Installing MemGPT from source using Poetry will ensure that you are using exact package versions that have been tested for the production build.

#### (Optional) Installing pre-commit
We recommend installing pre-commit to ensure proper formatting during development:
```
poetry run pre-commit install
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 2. 🛠️ Making Changes

### 🌟 Create a Branch

Time to put on your creative hat and make some magic happen. First, let's create a new branch for your awesome changes. 🧙‍♂️

```shell
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

### ✏️ Make your Changes

Now, the world is your oyster! Go ahead and craft your fabulous changes. 🎨

## 3. ✅ Testing

Before we hit the 'Wow, I'm Done' button, let's make sure everything works as expected. Run tests and make sure the existing ones don't throw a fit. And if needed, create new tests. 🕵️

### Run existing tests

Running tests if you installed via poetry:
```
poetry run pytest -s tests
```

Running tests if you installed via pip:
```
pytest -s tests
```

### Creating new tests
If you added a major feature change, please add new tests in the `tests/` directory.

## 4. 🧩 Adding new dependencies
If you need to add a new dependency to MemGPT, please add the package via `poetry add <PACKAGE_NAME>`. This will update the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files. If the dependency does not need to be installed by all users, make sure to mark the dependency as optional in the `pyproject.toml` file and if needed, create a new extra under `[tool.poetry.extras]`.

## 5. 🚀 Submitting Changes

### Check Formatting
Please ensure your code is formatted correctly by running:
```
poetry run black . -l 140
```

### 🚀 Create a Pull Request

1. Visit [MemGPT](https://github.com/cpacker/memgpt).
2. Click "New Pull Request" button.
3. Choose the base branch (`main`) and the compare branch (your feature branch).
4. Whip up a catchy title and describe your changes in the description. 🪄
